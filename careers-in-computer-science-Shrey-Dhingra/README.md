# Systems Eningeer (IT)

## __The Basics__
### _What is a Systems Engineer?_
---
The definition of system engineering is the integration of several disciplines to validate the use of engineering systems using the principles, concepts, and theories from scientific, technological, and management approaches.

System engineers are primarily in charge of planning, implementing, and starting an interdisciplinary approach to various engineering systems. In order to address issues, they attempt to obtain insight on all facets of a system. Products, people, services, information, natural components, or processes can all be considered as part of these "systems." For the successful deployment and use of such a system, one must be able to troubleshoot issues and communicate with all associations. The procedure that a system engineer goes through is illustrated in the picture below.

### _Typical Duties and Responsibilities_
---
- Creating, maintaining, and assisting with system software, hardware, and infrastructure components.
- Installing, maintaining, and supporting system software and hardware, as well as providing user support. - Setting up, troubleshooting, and maintaining various infrastructure platforms.
- Carrying out high-level root-cause analyses to identify the root causes of service interruptions and developing preventive measures

### _Educaiton:_
---
Although exentsive, there are quite a large variety of pathways one may take to become a systems engineer such as a:

1. Bachelor's Degree

   Obtaining a bachelor's degree in systems engineering or a similar discipline, such as computer engineering or mechanical engineering, is the first step in becoming a systems engineer. Some systems engineers might be bachelor's degree holders in technological fields like computer science.

2. Master's Degree
   
   Following receiving your bachelor's degree, earning your master's degree might help you further your career. Prior to obtaining your master's degree or even while you're seeking your graduate degree, it's a good idea to have some field experience.

   The majority of systems engineers who apply to master's degree programmes want to further their technical professions. Graduate programmes are more specialised and personalised since many applicants already know what sector they want to work in.

   You must possess a bachelor's degree in systems engineering, engineering, statistics, or a related subject to be eligible to apply. The other criteria for admission will differ each school.

3. Systems engineer certifications
   
   Another option to show a prospective employer that you have the qualifications for the position is to obtain a systems engineering certification. These are a few typical choices in the sector: 

   Some certifications include:
      - Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer (MCSE)
      - Certified Systems Engineering Professional (CSEP)
      - Master Certified Electronics Technician (CETma)
      - Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA)
      - Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP)
      - CompTIA Network+

4. Systems engineer skills
   A systems engineer must possess a broad range of abilities to comprehend what must take place inside a process, design a system to enable that process, implement the system, and see it through while keeping track of progress and correcting issues as they arise.

   Effective communication is essential because systems engineers must work with other engineers and programmers as well as end users and diverse stakeholders. For instance, systems engineers must be able to explain technical ideas to those with no technical knowledge.

   Your capacity to forecast outcomes and solve problems is also a must for this profession. Systems are made up of several tiny moving pieces that cooperate to produce a single outcome. Systems engineers must have unwavering focus on detail and the ability to perceive the larger picture.

   Some skills general skills include:

   - Communication
   - Analytical skills
   - Organizational skills
   - Detail-oriented thinking
   - Ability to see the “big picture”
   - Troubleshooting
   - Time management

### _Technical Skills & Non-Technical Skills:_
---


All employment requires technical skills, which are the abilities paired with the knowledge necessary to carry out particular activities that are relevant to the position. However depending on the sector one works in, this changes quite a bit for a systems engineer. So, having appropriate knowledge in all domains with reference to:

* Computer engineering
* Software development
* Project management
* Networking
* Cloud computing
* Data architecture and programming
* Risk management


Non-technical skills are those that a profession needs in order to perform the duties of that profession but which are not expressly associated with that profession. For a systems engineer, this entails problem-solving, analytical abilities, and critical thinking. It also includes troubleshooting. Together with teamwork and customer service abilities, communication skills are also quite important. Furthermore, since systems engineers frequently have a variety of tasks to do, time management is a critical ability.

### _Salary:_

## __Experiential Learning__
Although it is generally accepted that several years of schooling are necessary in order to work in any sector connected to technology, it is possible to accomplish so in various ways.

The two talents needed to be a systems engineer centre on both technical and non-technical elements.


Participating in co-op and internship programmes offered by the school is a crucial experiential learning pathway towards becoming a systems engineer.

- Students gain crucial job skills through co-op, enabling them to adapt to different work contexts rapidly.
- Students learn to apply what they learn in the classroom to real-world situations and to value the advantages of their education.
- In turn, this enables individuals to increase their expertise in their industry by applying the skills they gain to who they are as a whole. After graduation, they could still be allowed to work in their co-op placement, continuing their employment.

Project management abilities are one crucial trait for system engineers. These abilities are crucial because they teach how to create clear goals, operate in collaborative settings, and troubleshoot.
